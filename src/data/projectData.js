Many competitors offer their members training overviews etc. however Fitness24/7 does not. Having been an avid gymgoer & around other members for over 3 years it became apparent that others around me also have voiced this issue. This led me to the idea to improve upon the existing app by enabling the gymgoer who does not attend fitness classes to make use of the app.", style:"w-12/12 mt-8"},

            {id: 1, component: "CustomSection2", tag:"Research", name:"Research", text: "To get an understanding of how to make the app useful to more members I started my research by looking at the current app user.  Initially, current reviews on the Google Play & IOS app store where analyzed and pain points & positives were rated from low to high based on reoccurrence. To further consolidate findings, contextual inquiries & semistructed interviews were conducted. In the contextual inquiries users where observed when navigating the app and where given tasks, e.g. how they would usually book a fitness class. The main purpose of the interview was to get more information on what pain points users would experience and what currently worked well with the app.Painting a clear picture of the prospective users needs was significantly harder, however the same research procedure was conducted, starting with app reviews. After these had been analyzed, semi-structured interviews with 4 current gymgoers  who do not go to fitness classes were conducted. Affinity mapping was ultimately used to categorize and understand the gathered data, containing both user needs and current pain points.", style:"w-11/12 sm:w-10/12 md:w-6/12 mt-8" },

By creating two personas, one that frequently books classes & that only uses the gym facilities it was easier to pinpoint how and which changes would need to be implemented.", style:"w-12/12 mt-8"  },

Here I worked with a high fidelity prototype as simply wireframing the user experience wasn't enough to fully compare it to the original app. Some of the major changes included workout stats on the home screen (weekly workouts & hours spent at the gym) and a booked classes card displayed on the home screen. Also overall usability enhancement where tested with a filter fly-out menu on the booking screen and active filters embedded directly on the booking screen. ", style:"w-12/12 mt-8"},

It became clear that while the design was honing in on appealing to a larger member base the overall user experience was still in need of improvement. Testers experienced the home screen was now too cluttered and an easier overview of classes was still needed. Further, the filter fly-out menu prototype covered important content but also the filter option training goals was considered redundant. Users also expressed that the workout tracking feature could be condensed down to a single screen.",img:"placecholder" },

When designing the astra watch my intention was to create a high-end watch, an infusion of retro-tech watch elements ( LCD display similar to Casio watches) and traditional Swiss luxury watchmaking. In the design of the Astra Genesis watch naval accents were added to embrace the more adventurous side to the brand.
