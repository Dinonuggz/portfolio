          <p>This case study explored potential landing page designs for a personal project - Astra Watches. When designing the astra watch my intention was to create a high-end watch, an infusion of retro-tech watch elements ( LCD display similar to Casio watches) and traditional Swiss luxury watchmaking. In the design of the Astra Genesis watch naval accents were added to embrace the more adventurous side to the brand. These attributes would essentially be the foundation for building a brand & e-commerce landing page.</p>
