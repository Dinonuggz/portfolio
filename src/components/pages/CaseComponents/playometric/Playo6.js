        <p>The finished product was well received by both testers and graders from the industrial/interaction design faculty. However there are still aspects of the project I would have liked to work on further. </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 mt-4">Challenges</h3>
        <p>Time constraints made it impossible to create more than one prototype, having more than one prototype would have provided me with far better user testing data.</p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 mt-4">What can be improved?</h3>
        <p>Creating more prototypes so that a real-world scenario could be tested and then evaluate if the goal to design a fully inclusive jump-training game was achivied. Additionally, I would have liked to spend more time on testing materials to optimize the feel of the product and overall durabilty over prolonged time.</p>
