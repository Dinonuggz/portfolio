        <p>Upon letting users navigate the figma prototype, users rated the redesign considerably higher than the original. Overall, users expressed that the new user experience was more fluent than the original app, with considerable improvements to their booking experiences. Having the workout stats on the profile page was also considered a working solution - they could easily be found within the app, but hidden enough for those who wouldnâ€™t benefit from them. The newly added feature -the workout planner did also not negatively impact the user flows of those who probably would not use them. The workout planner itself was a design challenge as complexity could easily snowball affecting other aspects of the app design. 4 users who during the research stage suggested the addition of a workout planner would help them stay motivated, expressed that the addition was a great start, however that added functionality to the planner could make it more helpful. As this was a personal passion project done by myself with no affiliation to Fitness24/7 however, I had to put the brakes on it eventually and did not do another design iteration. A big contributing factor to the results in this case study is most likely the sample size of users who participated and have been interviewed in this study (a total of 8 participants). However I do believe the case study was built on a good foundation as a large amount of app reviews were also considered when conducting research and creating affinity maps.</p>
